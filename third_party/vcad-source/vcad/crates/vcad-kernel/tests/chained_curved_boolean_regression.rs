//! Tracked regression for a BRep boolean robustness bug exposed by chained
//! booleans over curved surfaces.
//!
//! Minimal trigger (all three required — removing any one makes it pass):
//!   1. a *filleted* body (curved blend faces),
//!   2. a *sphere* subtracted from it (leaves a concave spherical face), then
//!   3. a *cylinder* subtracted from that result (a curved tool).
//!
//! Expected: `(filleted_cube − sphere) − cylinder` is the body with a spherical
//! dish and a small cylindrical notch — its bounding box stays within the body
//! (z ≈ 0..28). Observed: the second difference produces invalid topology in
//! which the subtracted sphere *resurfaces as positive geometry*, ballooning the
//! bounding box to the sphere's extent (z ≈ 94).
//!
//! This is NOT a loon / IR / evaluator bug — the IR is a correct Difference
//! chain and the node evaluator composes it correctly (see
//! `vcad-eval/tests/loon_boolean_composition.rs`, which passes on planar
//! geometry). The fault is in the curved-surface SSI / classification path of
//! `vcad-kernel-booleans`. The companion tests
//! `chained_planar_boolean_is_robust` and `single_curved_difference_is_robust`
//! below are NOT ignored and guard the working cases.
//!
//! Fixed: the SSI circle path no longer splits a curved face by a "phantom"
//! circle built from a small planar partner's infinite carrier plane (e.g. a
//! cylinder cap), so the subtracted sphere stays trimmed away. The headline
//! test is no longer ignored and now guards against regressions.
