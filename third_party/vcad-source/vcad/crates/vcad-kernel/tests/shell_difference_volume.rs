//! Regression: hollow-box volume must track wall thickness, including through
//! a boolean cut (the vcad.io /prove demo path: cube → shell → difference).
//!
//! The analytical shell used to pre-reverse the inner loop *and* mark the
//! inner faces `Orientation::Reversed`; the tessellator reverses winding for
//! `Reversed` faces itself, so the two flips cancelled and the cavity was
//! wound outward — `volume()` reported outer + cavity, so a *thinner* wall
//! reported a *larger* volume.
